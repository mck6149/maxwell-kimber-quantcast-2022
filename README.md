I used Maven as a build tool to make a java program for the most active cookie assignment.

For testing, I have a test directory where I have JUnit5 tests set up for my functions. 

I have used Maven to make an executable jar file. 

If you want to run your own files, please place them in the route directory. Currently I have cookie_log1.csv as
the only log file the program can run with.
